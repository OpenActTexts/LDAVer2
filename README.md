# Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal

The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. The text *Loss Data Analytics* represents our first book.  

## Loss Data Analytics

### Book Description

*Loss Data Analytics* is an interactive, online, freely available text.

* The online version contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
   *  The book is available at [Online Version, Edition Two](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDAVer2/).
   *  The first edition of the book is available at [Online Version, Edition One](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html)
* A subset of the book is available for offline reading in pdf format.

* *Unresolved Issue.* Loading KableExtra generates a conflict with other jquery dependencies. In principle (according to ChapGPT), one loads the jquery libraries first, then KableExtra. Efforts using this approach are so far unsuccessful. As a hack, we went to the 'lib' folder within the docs folder and renamed bsTable-3.3.7 to bsTable-3.3.7OLD, so it would not be called. What a hack but it seems to do the trick...


## Github Resources

*GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal.

*  The more stable version is available through the ["Production" Github Landing Site](https://OpenActTexts.github.io) - designed for students and classes. 
*  The more frequently updated  version is available through the ["Development" Github Landing Site](https://openacttextdev.github.io) - designed for instructors and developers.

Code, data, offline versions and more are available through these portals.
