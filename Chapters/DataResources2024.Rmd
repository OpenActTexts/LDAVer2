This appendix section describes the datasets used in this book and others that you may wish to explore.

For each set of data, we provide download buttons so that you can easily access the data in standard .csv (comma separated value) format. This allows you replicate and experiment with the methods developed in the book as well as sharpen your understanding through exercises.

We provide the source of each dataset. We also recommend, for deeper understanding, that you occasionally refer to these original sources to further develop your appreciation of the data underpinning the analytics developed in this book.


##  Wisconsin Property Fund {#S:WiscPropFundA}


**Description**: The Wisconsin Local Government Property Insurance Fund (LGPIF) is an insurance pool administered by the Wisconsin Office of the Insurance Commissioner. The LGPIF was established to provide property insurance for local government entities that include counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, and library boards. The fund insures local government property such as government buildings, schools, libraries, and motor vehicles. It covers all property losses except those resulting from flood, earthquake, wear and tear, extremes in temperature, mold, war, nuclear reactions, and embezzlement or theft by an employee.

## ANU Corporate Travel Data {#Sec:DataTravel}

```{r echo = FALSE}

TravelClaims <- read.csv("Data/ANUTravelClaims2022.csv")
```

Universities purchase corporate travel policies to cover employees and students traveling on official university business for a wide variety of accidents and incidents while away from the campus or primary workplace. This broad coverage includes medical care and evacuation, loss of personal property, extraction for political and weather related reasons, and more. See  @frees2022ANURisks for more information about this coverage.

There are `r nrow(TravelClaims)` observations in this dataset. The variable names are described in Table \@ref(tab:DescribeTravel) and the first and last five observations are in Table \@ref(tab:PrintNumTravel).

## ANU Group Personal Accident Data {#Sec:DataGPA}

```{r echo = FALSE}

GPAClaims <- read.csv("Data/ANUGroupPersonalAccidentClaims2022.csv",header=T)
```

Group personal accident insurance offers financial protection in case of injury or death resulting from an incident that occurs on the job. Like workers’ compensation, group personal accident offers insurance coverage and liability insurance protection against accidental death or injury. Unlike workers’ compensation, group personal accident covers students and ANU’s voluntary workers.  See  @frees2022ANURisks for more information about this coverage.

 There are `r nrow(GPAClaims)` observations in this dataset. The variable names are described in Table \@ref(tab:DescribeGPA) and the first and last five observations are in Table \@ref(tab:PrintNumGPA).

These data were drawn from a larger database of 40,284 insurance private customers. These customers are tracked from 2010 to 2014. Some customers do not renew their policies, so that they do not stay in the sample for five years. For the smaller data, only the 2014 policy year was used and from this, a random sample of 10,000 customers was drawn. 

\newpage

See @frees2021dependence  for more information about this dataset. The larger database contains 122935 rows and is freely available at:

## 'R' Package CASdatasets {#S:CASDatasets}

The `R` package `CASdatasets` provides a convenient way to access many well-known insurance datasets. This package was originally created to support the book *Computational Actuarial Science with R*, edited by Arthur Charpentier, @charpentier2014computational. 

To install the package, here is a bit of `R` code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("CASdatasets", repos = "http://cas.uqam.ca/pub/",
                 type="source")
library(CASdatasets)
?CASdatasets
?sgautonb # See the documentation of the Singapore Auto Data
?lossalae # See the documentation of the Loss and Expense Data
```    

Note that this package assumes that you have already installed a few other packages, including *xts*, *sp*, and *zoo*.

To illustrate, 

*  in Chapter \@ref(ChapFrequency-Modeling) we use the Singapore data (referred to as `sgautonb` in the package) and 
*  in Chapter \@ref(ChapDependenceModel) we use the loss and expense data (referred to as `lossalae` in the package).
    

## Other Data Sources

There exists man other (non-actarial) data sources. First, data can be obtained from university-based researchers who collect primary data. Second, data can be obtained from organizations that are set up for the purpose of releasing secondary data for the general research community. Third, data can be obtained from national and regional statistical institutes that collect data. Finally, companies have corporate data that can be obtained for research purposes.

While it might be difficult to obtain data to address a specific research problem or answer a business question, it is relatively easy to obtain data to test a model or an algorithm for data analysis. In the modern era, readers can obtain datasets from the Internet. The following is a list of some websites to obtain real-world data:

*  **UCI Machine Learning Repository.** This website (url: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)) maintains more than 400 datasets that can be used to test machine learning algorithms.
*  **Kaggle.** The Kaggle website (url: [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/)) include real-world datasets used for data science competitions. Readers can download data from Kaggle by registering an account.
